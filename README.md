# Discord Bot feito com API de pagamento RisePay

I created a Discord bot using the RisePay payment API to explore the use of payment gateway APIs and improve my skills. Alongside that, I also developed a complete authentication API system with HWID lock. If anyone wants to check it out and give it a try, the code is available! :)
